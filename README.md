# Bio
Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll be talking about my life experiences and interesting things I'd like to share. I'm a digital artist, but it tends to be fanart. I can make anything as long as I keep interest in it. This is currently a work-in-progess, so please don't judge me too hard!

# First Post (10.11.20)
Today, I think I'll talk about my life and what I like to do. Generally, I tend to draw because it interests me more than doing homework. This leads me to procrastinate, unfortunately, but I still get my assignments done.



Other than that, I like anime and video games a whole lot, so that distracts me too. I keep to myself at home, however, because my sister doesn't respect anything I like at all and will discourage me from liking anything that she is neutral about or doesn't like.

My friends are really supportive, and I really appreciate how kind they are. They let me talk about anything (well, not ANYTHING anything) and they won't criticize me for it. I genuinely hope that we can stay friends, because we go together well even if we're such different people.

One of them even made this cute picture for our group.



I've never been more glad to have anyone in my life.
